<p>WalkerCMS initially started with a homebrew driver. Then a coworker showed me the
<a href="www.codeigniter.com" title="CodeIgniter Framwork">CodeIgniter Framework</a>. I reworked
the app to use CodeIgniter models, views, and controllers. The downside to both the homebrew and
CodeIgniter was that unit-testing was difficult if not impossible. Later, I stumbled upon the
<a href="http://laravel.com/" title="Laravel Framework">Laravel Framework</a> and found that unit
testing was not only possible, but easy.</p>
<p>WalkerCMS is currently based on Laravel 3.2.12, though there is still work to be done to
get it feature-equivalent to the previous CodeIgniter based edition.</p>
